        <p class="div2">Creative Director John Galliano’s mesmerising collection examines the ritual of dressing as a physical expression of emotion. Dolls were a point of reference illustrated by the marionette-like way in which several models walked.</p>
        <p class="div2">The collection was showcased under Pont Alexandre III in Paris with sinister smoke-under-the-bridge mis-an-scéne inspired by Brassai’s iconic photos of nocturnal Paris, transported the show's guests into the bohemian atmosphere of a Parisian evening accompanied by the sound of the Seine. The atmosphere was intimate and evocative. Set in an abandoned speakeasy, the collection was a theatrical exploration of the city’s underbelly, populated by characters who were both glamorous and deeply human.</p>
