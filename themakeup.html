      	<h1>Makeup Looks by Pat McGrath</h1>
      	<p>Experimenting with silhouette, texture, and innovative couture techniques, the collection takes us on a moody, moonlit walk along the Seine in Paris, where we meet a cast of exquisite muses presented in a beautiful tableau. “The makeup for the show plays with a modern take on porcelain glass skin,” says Pat. Brows are bleached, replaced by pencil-thin arches drawn on using neutral-toned shadows. Variations of a painterly eye appear in a stunning array of jewel tones, pastels or moody charcoals. Cream blush is applied to the centre of the cheeks for a doll-like flush. On the lips, subversive shades of blooded red and black are topped in clear gloss for a surreal pout. Finally, skin is coated in a hyper-shiny glaze, mimicking the smooth, reflective quality of glass and completing the models’ unbelievable metamorphosis.</p>
      	<h1>Words by Pat Mcgrath Herself</h1>
      	<p>"The collection explored the idea of Paris by moonlight on the Seine, with exquisite muses coming to life in a beautiful tableau and in a painterly way. The highlight of the look was this modern take on porcelain glass skin, which we achieved by making the models’ faces as shiny and reflective as glass."</p>
